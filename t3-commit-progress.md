# Upstream (T3 Code) sync log

Ronin is a fork of [pingdotgg/t3code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code) with a deliberate cut:
desktop only, no mobile app, no T3 Connect / Clerk / hosted relay, no WSL, no legacy sidebar, no
Playwright preview automation. Upstream commits are therefore **triaged, not merged**.

This file is the watermark. On the next sync, only look at commits _after_ the SHA below — every
commit at or before it has already been judged, and the verdict is recorded here.

## Watermark

|                               |                                                                                           |

## How to triage the next batch

```bash
git fetch upstream
git log --oneline 5015d7cf9..upstream/main          # the new commits

# For each commit: which files does it touch that this fork still has,
# and have we already diverged on them?
MB=$(git merge-base HEAD upstream/main)
git log --reverse --format='%h|%s' 5015d7cf9..upstream/main | while IFS='|' read -r h s; do
  shared=0; forked=0
  while read -r st f; do
    [ "$st" = A ] && continue
    git cat-file -e "HEAD:$f" 2>/dev/null || continue
    shared=$((shared+1))
    git diff --quiet "$MB" HEAD -- "$f" || forked=$((forked+1))
  done < <(git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-status -r "$h")
  echo "$h shared=$shared weTouched=$forked :: $s"
done
```

**A patch that fails to reverse-apply does not mean it is missing.** Four commits in the batch below
were already in the tree and only looked pending because our own edits had moved the surrounding
context. Always confirm by grepping for the change itself before porting it.

Checks to run after a batch: `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`.

## Batch 1 — reviewed through `5015d7cf9` (31 commits)

### Ported (14)

Ten applied clean; four needed adaptation.

| `f0b57ca23` | feat(web): add Open VSX theme search (#5654)                                | **adapted** — see below                                                                                                          |

`f0b57ca23` needed three fork-specific decisions:

- Upstream's dependency block re-added `jose` (Connect/Clerk auth). Only `jsonc-parser` and `jszip`
  were taken; `jose` stays out of `apps/web`.
- Upstream's picker uses `ThemePreviewCircle` (a gradient ball). This fork replaced it with a flat
  shell mockup, `ThemePreviewSwatch`, which was module-private — it is now exported and the new
  Open VSX UI points at it.
- Two new collection tests compared `replaceCustomThemeCollection`'s return against raw
  `parseThemeFile` output. Our Ronin default palettes (`SAKURA_*_COLORS`) are hex literals while the
  stored-theme path canonicalizes every role to OKLCH, so the assertions now compare against the
  canonical form via a `withCanonicalColors` helper.

  **Known inconsistency, not fixed here:** `getDefaultThemeColors` returning hex while storage
  returns OKLCH is a real wrinkle in this fork. Canonicalizing the default palettes at module load
  would remove it, but that changes every default color's runtime spelling and was out of scope for
  a port.

### Already in the tree (5) — do not re-port

Taken earlier (mostly via `264bd1e2c` "Take the upstream fixes that apply to what this fork still
has") or solved independently. Listed because their patches no longer reverse-apply and they will
look pending to a naive check.

### Verification

- `pnpm typecheck` — 0 errors
- `apps/web` — 234 files / 2312 tests pass
- `pnpm lint` — 3 pre-existing errors, all in files this batch never touched
  (`DroidAcpSupport.ts`, `AntigravityAdapter.ts`, `storageDocument.test.ts`)

**Pre-existing failure, unrelated to this batch:** `scripts/build-desktop-artifact.test.ts` →
"switches desktop packaging product names to nightly" expects `"Ronin (Alpha)"` but
`resolveDesktopProductName` reads `desktopPackageJson.productName`, now `"Ronin"`. Fails on `main`
too; the test was not updated when the product name changed.
